    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const copy_players = players.slice();
    copy_players[3] = 'Big Poppy';

    console.log(players);
    console.log(copy_players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const copy_players2 = [].concat(players);
    copy_players2[3] = 'Very big poppy';

    console.log(players);
    console.log(copy_players2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const copy_players3 = [...players];
    copy_players3[3] = 'Small poppy';

    console.log(players);
    console.log(copy_players3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const copy_person = {...person};  <== not working

    const copy_person = Object.assign({}, person, {'phone': 123, 'age': 87});

    console.log(person);
    console.log(copy_person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
